Names: Sultan Alshakrah, Jonathan Taing

The WW2 Strategy Game is a Java-based game that revolves around resource management. When you start the game, you will interact with a command-line interface and choose one of the eight countries available. Each country will have a budget in dollars, gold, oil, gas, minerals, food, soldiers, tanks, and airplanes. The game offers various difficulty levels as some countries may have bad starting resources while others may have strong ones.

Once you choose a country, you will have the following options:

1- Develop technology
2- Extract resources from the ground (gold, oil, gas, minerals, food)
3- Sell resources
4- Spy on another country to identify weaknesses to exploit
5-  Attack a country
6- Train soldiers, pilots, and tank drivers
7- Produce weapons, airplanes, and tanks

You must conquer the other seven countries within a 30-year timeline. If you fail to do so by the end of Year 30, you will lose the game. At the end of the game, you will receive a summary file that contains all of the actions you have taken during the past 30 years.

The game aims to challenge players to manage resources effectively and overcome obstacles. It is designed to be engaging and fun.
